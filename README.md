# About

This bot was created for the reason of helping people who want to create a discord bot in Go but do not know this repository is 100% free if you want to use it without problems leganes 
this discord bot is 100% customizable but if you don't have much experience programming in Go I recommend that you take a course or watch tutorials to avoid problems when programming the bot.
