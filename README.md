# About

This bot was created for the reason of helping people who want to create a discord bot in Go but do not know this repository is 100% free if you want to use it without problems leganes 
this discord bot is 100% customizable but if you don't have much experience programming in Go I recommend that you take a course or watch tutorials to avoid problems when programming the bot.

# Support

If you do not know how to use the code you can see some GO courses or you can connect me on my discord
you can also join programming servers.
